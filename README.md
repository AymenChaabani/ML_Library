# ML Library

Developing a Machine Learning library containing the most known ML algorithms such as Linear regression,logistic regression, KNN, SVM,Decision Tree, and neural networks such as ANN and CNN based only on numpy library.

## Authors

 Aymen Chaabani


## Environment Setup 

1. Start by creating the virtual Environment

```bash
 conda create --name My_env --file Requirements.txt &&
 conda activate My_env
```
2. install the requirement modules 
```bash
conda install numpy matplotlib
```

3. Extract the name of the weights for SegFormer from the following link and provide its corresponding path to the variable 'model_checkpoint'

## Modules contained in the Library  
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Kmean
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- SVM
- Simple Ann
- CNN
